    <p><b><big><p style="color:blueviolet">Nature is the ultimate source of our living.</br> Both living and non-living things include nature, and </br>everyone is interdependent, which helps maintain the </br>ecosystem. Plants, animals, and humans all depend on nature for </br>their survival. It supplies oxygen, sunlight, soil, water, </br>and other necessary components.</big></p></p></b>
  <h1><center><big>Spend Time in Nature to Reduce Stress and Anxiety</big></center></h1>

  <h1><big><right>Keep outside in mind for less stress</big></right></h1>
  <p><b><big>Spending time in nature can help relieve stress and anxiety, improve your mood and boost </br>feelings of happiness and well-being. Whatever you call it – forest bathing, </br>ecotherapy, mindfulness in nature, green time or the wilderness cure ‒ humans evolved in the great </br>outdoors, and your brain may benefit from a journey back to nature.</big></b></p>
  <h1><right><big>Get out</big></right></h1>
  <p><b><big>Have you been feeling down lately? A little sluggish, stressed out or maybe wondering,</br> “What’s life all about?” 

    Here’s another question: How much time have you spent in nature lately?</br>
    
    The answer to these two questions might be more closely related than you’d think.</br>
    
    The modern way we live has changed radically from life in the savanna, but our brains have </br>mostly stayed the same. We still have</br> a deep connection with nature, and research shows </br>that if we don’t nourish that bond despite our technological advancements, we may be </br>affected in many ways.</big></b></p>
<h1><b><big>Feel better</big></b></h1>
<p><b><big>If you’re able to, get back to nature to energize your mind and body. Research has shown </br>spending 120 minutes a week in nature improves health and well-being</big></b></p>
<h2><b>Depressed: </b></h2>
<p><b>If you’re feeling blue, try going outside to green, natural spaces. A stroll in the woods has been</br> shown to help combat depression, and even just the view of the forest from </br>a hospital room helps patients who are feeling down. Head for the hills if you need a boost to </br>your mood.</b></p>
<h2><b>Stressed:</b></h2>
<p><b>Nature presents scenes that gently capture your attention instead of suddenly </br>snatching it, calming your nerves instead of frazzling them.</b></p>
<h2><b>Anxious:</b></h2>
<p><b>You probably know that physical activity is good for your state of mind. But did you </br>know that working out in nature helps to reduce anxiety, among other benefits, even more </br>than going to an indoor gym? Consider hitting some trails to get the best mental bang for your buck. </b></p>
<h2><b>Self-Involved:</b></h2>
<p><b>If you dwell on your problems and just can’t stop, a walk through a meadow might</br> put the brakes on the thought train circling through your head. Research shows that a </br>90-minute walk in nature lowers activity in the part of the brain linked to negative thoughts.  </b></p>
<h2><b>Fatigued: </b></h2>
<p><b>Are you constantly multitasking at work as you switch between customers</br> and phone calls, or click from spreadsheets to presentations? Even at home, you might face a </br>combination of kids, chores and devices vying for your attention. Your prefrontal cortex can </br>only take so much distraction before it needs a recharge. Luckily, time in nature has been </br>shown to restore mental abilities like short-term memory and processing 3D images based</br> on drawings.</b></p>
<h2><b>Antisocial:</b></h2>
<p><b>Time in nature can help with your personal relationships, too. Natural beauty</br> results in more prosocial behaviors, like generosity and empathy.  
</b></p>
<h2><b>Disconnected: </b></h2>
<p><b>One of the most basic human needs is to feel that you belong and you are</br> part of a larger tribe. But studies show that this concept goes beyond human relationships alone.</br> Time in nature results in a sense of belonging to the wider world that is vital for mental health.</b></p>

<p><b><big>Nature is always calling and inviting us to connect and find repose.
